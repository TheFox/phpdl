PHP Downloader
	for rapidshare.com & co.

Description
	PHP Downloader (or PHPDL) is a webbased download manager for rapidshare.com links (or
	similar). You can install PHPDL on your webserver and manage the downloads over the web interface.
	In the background there is a other script running which is downloading the files.

Features
	- Multiuser.
	- Web interface. Manage your downloads from everywhere.
	- Packet speed limit.
	- Export packet informations as txt.
	- RSDF files support.
	- DLC files support.
	- RapidShare.com (Free and Pro) support.

Install
	1. git clone git://github.com/TheFox/phpdl.git phpdl
	2. cd phpdl
	3. ./install/install.sh
	4. Run install/install.php in your browser.
	5. After installation delete the "install" directory.
	6. Run ./startstack in your terminal.

Security
	wget is used to download the files. Each file has a own wget process. If you have a pro account it could be that the password is shown in the process list of your pc/server! If you don't want to show other users your one click hoster password, don't enter it in the hosters table!
